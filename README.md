## 🔴About
My project is a 2D ping pong game with a unique dungeon knight theme. In this game, the player takes on the role of a brave knight, navigating through a dark and eerie dungeon. The game maintains the classic mechanics of ping pong, but with a twist: the setting, characters, and visuals are all designed to immerse the player in a medieval fantasy world. The paddles are represented by the knight's shield and sword, adding a thematic flair to the gameplay. The dungeon environment features torches, stone walls, and ambient sound effects to enhance the immersive experience.

The second player or enemy in the game is a menacing goblin, adding a layer of excitement and challenge. The goblin character is designed with attention to detail, making it both engaging and visually appealing. As players hit the ball back and forth, they must contend with the goblin's cunning moves and unpredictable behavior, making each match a thrilling encounter. This combination of classic ping pong mechanics with a fantasy theme creates a unique and enjoyable gaming experience, appealing to fans of both arcade games and medieval fantasy adventures.
